# Complex-Data-ETL-using-Python-3.7

This is surely one of my milestone projects when it comes to Python development and ETL. This 1000+ lines of code takes in .twb files, extracts metadata such as workbook name, dimensions, measures, calculated fields, filters, parameters, etc. and creates a standardized dataset in an excel spreadsheet.
The code has been continuously evolved to meet changing requirements.
It makes heavy use of python libraries such as pandas, regex, xmltree, itertools, etc.
Also, I managed to build a basic UI around the code that way users don't accidentally modify any part of the code
